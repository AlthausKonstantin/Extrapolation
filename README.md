# Extrapolation

This repository contains code and notebooks complementary
to my Bachelor's thesis.

If you want to use these algorithms, consider using their
improved implementations in [JuliaFiffEq.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq).
I added them to that more professional environment in April 2019.
